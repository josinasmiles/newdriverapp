          The penalties for driving while under the influence of alcohol or drugs are severe. In Pennsylvania, if you are of
          legal drinking age <b>(21 or older)</b>, you are considered to be driving <b>"while under the influence"</b> if your blood alcohol
          level is .08 or higher. But, you also may be convicted of DUI at lower BAC levels, if you are stopped by police for
          driving erratically (too slow, too fast, straddling your lane, making wide turns, stopping for no reason, failing to obey
          traffic signs and signals, etc.). </td>
