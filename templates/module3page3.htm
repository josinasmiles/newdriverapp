          reduce the severity of neck injuries in a crash. Adjust your head restraint so the top of the head restraint is at
          least as high as the top of your ears. Check your ownerâ€™s manual for instructions.</td>

        <td> Locking your doors and wearing your seat belt will help to ensure you will not be thrown
          from your vehicle in a crash. Being thrown from a vehicle increases your chances of death by 75 percent. It will
          also reduce the likelihood of being carjacked or otherwise victimized when you stop at an intersection or
          pull into a parking lot.</td>
