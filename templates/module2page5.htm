          the railroad tracks. You are required to stop at all railroad crossings when there is a
          signal of an approaching train. These signals include flashing red lights, a lowered crossing
          gate, a flagger signaling or a trainâ€™s audible signal of warning. <b>Do not</b> move forward or attempt
          to go around any gate or ignore any signal of an approaching train. If there are no signals at the
          railroad crossing, you should slow down and prepare to stop, if you see or hear a train approaching.</td>

          crossing safety.</td>
