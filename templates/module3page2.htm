          objects, such as backpacks, luggage and tools in your trunk, whenever possible, or secure them with the

          mirrors may have to be adjusted differently for each driver. The rearview mirror should be set so you can see
          the traffic directly behind your vehicle. The side mirror(s) should be set so when you lean left/right you can just
          barely see the side of your vehicle. Set the mirrors after you adjust your seat. </td>
